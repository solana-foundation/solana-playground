-- Unquoted snake_case here, unlike the Better Auth tables next door: these are
-- ours. The only crossing is `user_id`, which must quote "user" because that
-- is a reserved word.

-- migrate:up

-- `id` is text rather than uuid on purpose. A tutorial's project id is
-- derived (`tut:<slug>`) so two devices converge on one row for the same
-- tutorial without coordinating; a personal project gets a client-minted uuid,
-- because two projects that happen to share a name are not the same project.
-- Keyed by (user_id, id), not id alone. A tutorial's id is derived from its
-- name so that two devices agree on it without coordinating, which means every
-- user who starts Hello Anchor produces the same `tut:hello-anchor`. Under a
-- global primary key the second user to ever open a tutorial would collide
-- with the first -- and with `on conflict do nothing`, silently attach to a row
-- somebody else owns.
-- `timestamptz(3)`, not bare `timestamptz`, on every column here and below.
-- These timestamps cross into JavaScript and come back: `updated_at` is handed
-- to a client as the token it must echo to prove its write is not built on a
-- stale read. Postgres keeps microseconds, `Date#toISOString` emits
-- milliseconds, so a full-precision `now()` round-trips as a value that can
-- never equal what is stored -- every optimistic write would report a conflict
-- with itself. Storing what the wire format can represent removes the class of
-- bug rather than making each comparison remember to truncate.
