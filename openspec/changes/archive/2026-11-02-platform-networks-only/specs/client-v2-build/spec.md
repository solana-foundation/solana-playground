## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Minification keeps the names of `_Pg` classes

The minified production bundle SHALL keep the name of every class and function
whose name starts with `_Pg`, because change events are named after it. CI
SHALL fail when the built bundle lacks one of those names.

#### Scenario: The bundle carries the decorator class names (manual)

- **WHEN** CI builds the production bundle
- **THEN** a CI step finds `_PgConnection` and `_PgProgramInfo` as names in
  the built JavaScript, and fails the run when either is missing

#### Scenario: Dependent change events in the production build (manual)

- **WHEN** the production build is served and the connection's endpoint is
  changed in settings from Devnet to Mainnet
- **THEN** the cluster label in the bottom bar changes to Mainnet, and the tab
  does not freeze in a loop of change events
